                <h3>GitHub will allow us to do several things:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>1.</h5>
                        <p>GitHub will version control all of your code for Web 2. Which means you might make a mistake and not notice that mistake for hours or even days. If you project is in GitHub you can hop back into the commits and locate at what point you made this mistake.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>2.</h5>
                        <p>GitHub will allow you to share your repo with me and I will be able to branch your work and answer your questions about your code.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>3.</h5>
                        <p>GitHub will allow you to be anywhere on planet Earth ( even though everyone is stuck at home ), login to your GitHub account and have all the files you need to keep working.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
