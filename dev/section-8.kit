                    <p>Give the repo a name ( you cannot have any spaces in the name), you don't have to add a description, always set the repo to public ( so that you can share the repo with me if needed ) and check Initialize this repository with a README ( this will add a file into the repo on the next step and make cloning the repo easier for you ) .</p>
